# First-Ml

This is my first machine learning classification project.

For the sake of example and testing, I used a cats and dogs. For the final test, I used a picture of kittens as it resembles puppies the most.

This program is binary classification as it uses sigmoid activation.

In order to use this program, you need tensorflow to be installed on your pc and a valid interpreter for it(I used miniconda in my case)

I adapted the code so that any two types of classes are classified with proper output at the end of the code.

The only thing required of the user is changing the dataset on the data directory with the folders they choose to use. Extra visualization was added for more help seeing the classes and their index. 

If anyone needs help with understanding this even after all the comments, feel free to contact me
